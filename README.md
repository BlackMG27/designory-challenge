## My Work Decisions 
1. I divided my work into different components 
2. I used Women's History Month as the theme.
3. I used flexbox as design system because it was only one page and it felt more appropriate
4. I used 2 different colors with tints to enhance the design
5. I tired incorpoarting accessibilty standards using A11y Style Guide for reference
